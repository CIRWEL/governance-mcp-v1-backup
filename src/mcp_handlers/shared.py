    Get the agent_state module singleton (canonical business logic module).

    This utility function eliminates the repeated import pattern found across
    multiple handler files. Returns src.agent_state which contains all shared
    state (agent_metadata, monitors, etc.) and business logic.

    Historical note: Previously returned src.mcp_server_std which mixed
    transport code with business logic. Now returns src.agent_state which
    is the clean extraction of just the business logic.
