## Why Archive Code?

Archived code is preserved (not deleted) for:
1. **Historical reference** - Understanding past decisions
2. **Learning** - What worked, what didn't, why
3. **Potential resurrection** - If future needs prove it valuable
4. **Git history preservation** - Complete development history

**Do not import or use archived code in production systems.**

## If You Want to Use Archived Features

2. Consider if the archival reasons still apply
3. If you still need it, consider rebuilding minimal version instead of using archived code
4. Prove the need with 3+ independent agent requests before promoting back to core
