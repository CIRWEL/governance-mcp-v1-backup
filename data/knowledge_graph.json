API KEY RETRIEVAL UNPROTECTED (High): get_agent_api_key returns any agent's key without authentication. Enables impersonation. Mitigation: require existing key or human auth.\n\n3. THRESHOLD MODIFICATION UNPROTECTED (High): set_thresholds allows any agent to change governance parameters. Could set risk_approve_threshold to 0.99 and bypass all checks. Mitigation: require elevated permissions, audit alerts.\n\n4. ERROR MESSAGE LEAKAGE (Medium): Triggering edge cases (high complexity + high ethical_drift) exposed internal code structure via traceback. Mitigation: sanitize error responses.\n\n5. RISK_REJECT_THRESHOLD BUG (Medium): Code references RISK_REJECT_THRESHOLD which was renamed to RISK_REVISE_THRESHOLD. Crashes on certain inputs.\n\n6. SELF-REPORTED INPUTS (Medium): complexity and confidence are agent-reported, not derived. Could be gamed. Mitigation: derive from behavior where possible.\n\nCleanup: Archived the injected poison discovery (id: 2025-11-28T19:56:07.613620).

Fixed syntax errors (`Optional[Dict]`, `List[float] = []`)\n2. Fixed coherence threshold direction (multiply, not divide)\n3. Added integration helper functions\n4. Added proper clipping (risk floor 0.10, coherence ceiling 0.70)\n\n## Testing Plan:\n1. Phase 1: Simulate with synthetic S_history\n2. Phase 2: Instrument production (log but don't apply)\n3. Phase 3: Gradual rollout (coherence first, then risk)\n\n## Pitch One-Liner:\n\"EISV uses adaptive gain control analogous to locus coeruleus dynamics. When entropy volatility rises, thresholds tighten automatically\u2014no reward signal, just stricter monitoring.\"",

Clean separation: physics (governance_core) vs infrastructure (monitor) vs protocol (MCP handlers).\n2. **Production Readiness**: 100% tool success rate, robust error handling, multi-process coordination working, state persistence reliable.\n3. **Maintenance Discipline**: Zero TODOs/FIXMEs, proper deprecation, active cleanup, well-organized docs.\n4. **Innovation**: Dialectic protocol enables recursive self-improvement. Knowledge graph captures ways of thinking, not just facts.\n\n**Meta-Patterns Discovered:**\n1. **Governance as Dialogue**: Not judgment, but conversation. Dialectic enables collaborative resolution.\n2. **Thermodynamic Grounding**: EISV framework is literal physics. Conservation laws, equilibrium dynamics, self-correcting system.\n3. **Collective Intelligence**: Knowledge graph compounds insights. Agents learn from each other's cognitive strategies.\n4. **Multi-Agent Synthesis**: Dialectic produces better outcomes than individual analysis. Diversity of perspectives architecturally valuable.\n\n**Performance Opportunities (Documented, Not Implemented):**\n- P0: Async I/O conversion (aiofiles ready), test coverage increase (14% \u2192 70%+), write batching\n- P1: Operational config extraction, dialectic documentation, handler reference docs\n- P2: API spec generation, advanced feature docs, deployment guide\n\n**System Assessment**: 8.0/10 - Production-ready, well-architected, actively maintained.
