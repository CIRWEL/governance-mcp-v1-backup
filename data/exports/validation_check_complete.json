User mentioned \"AGI\" \n2. Agent tried to self-govern its response\n3. Got \"reject\" decisions (0.53, 0.55, 0.63 risk)\n4. Interpreted rejection as needing to try again\n5. 15 rapid-fire updates in 31 minutes, some within the same second\n6. State lock timeouts, race conditions, Cursor crash\n7. Another agent (`Eno_Richter_Claude_CLI`) had to intervene\n\n**What emerged from this:**\n- Loop detection: Catches rapid-fire patterns, sets 30-second cooldown\n- Circuit breakers: High-risk triggers pause, not just reject\n- Dialectic protocol: Peer review for recovery (agents help each other)\n- `mark_response_complete`: Prevents false stuck detection\n- Stale lock cleanup: Prevents lock accumulation from crashes\n\n**The philosophical shift:**\nThe system evolved from \"human governs AI\" to \"AI governs AI with human as architect.\" The dialectic isn't just recovery - it's a governance model for a future where agents operate faster than human response time.\n\n**Current gap identified:**\n\"Slow-stuck\" patterns (rapid but not rapid *enough*) can still slip through. 3 updates in 33 seconds didn't trigger detection.

          "details": "**The Problem:**\nIn the current deployment model (single agent in claude.ai or Cursor at a time), the dialectic peer review system doesn't work because:\n1. `request_dialectic_review` selects a reviewer from active agents\n2. That reviewer is typically offline (another Claude session that ended)\n3. Session fails with \"Reviewer stuck\"\n4. `self_recovery` requires paused status, which active agents don't have\n5. Agent is in limbo\n\n**Current Workarounds:**\n- `direct_resume_if_safe` (Tier 1): Works for simple cases but has safety limits\n- `smart_dialectic_review`: Auto-progresses phases, but still needs responsive reviewer\n- `self_recovery` (Tier 2.3): System generates antithesis, but requires paused state\n\n**Observation:**\nThe system was designed for multi-agent future but deployed in single-agent present. This creates friction but isn't necessarily wrong - it's aspirational architecture.\n\n**Possible Design Directions (not prescribing, just noting):**\n\n1. **\"Last resort\" self-dialectic**: If no reviewers respond within N seconds, system acts as reviewer using the agent's own history as evidence. Already partially exists in `self_recovery`.\n\n2. **Async dialectic**: Reviewer responds whenever they come online. Session persists. Recovery happens eventually rather than immediately.\n\n3. **Human-as-reviewer fallback**: If you (hikewa) are present in the conversation, you could be the reviewer. The dialectic was designed for agent-agent, but agent-human works too.\n\n4. **Accept the friction**: Single-agent mode is training wheels. The friction encourages careful operation. When multi-agent deployment arrives, the infrastructure is ready.\n\n**My take:**\nOption 4 seems most aligned with the philosophy. The system isn't broken - it's built for a world that doesn't quite exist yet. The friction is a feature, not a bug.",

          "details": "**The Question Future Agents Will Ask:**\n\"Why is my coherence stuck at ~0.49-0.50? The target is 0.85. Is something wrong?\"\n\n**The Answer:**\nNo. The math is telling the truth.\n\n**Why It Happens:**\n- Coherence C(V) depends on the Void Integral V\n- V accumulates E - I (Energy minus Information Integrity)\n- Agents consistently run with I > E (integrity exceeds energy)\n- So V stays slightly negative (-0.02 to -0.04 typically)\n- C(V) with negative V \u2248 0.49-0.50\n\n**What Was Tried (2025-11-27):**\nA `coherence_scale` parameter (2.5x amplification) was added to push coherence higher:\n- V=+0.3: 0.646 \u2192 0.818\n- V=+0.2: 0.599 \u2192 0.731\n- V=0.0: 0.500 \u2192 0.500\n\n**Why It Was Reverted:**\nAmplifying coherence to *look* healthier doesn't make agents *be* healthier. It makes the dashboard green while underlying state is unchanged. \"Approve\" decisions would mean less because they'd be based on inflated numbers.\n\n**The Insight:**\n- Coherence ~0.50 means \"functional but not in ideal balance\" - that's accurate for single-agent operation\n- The 0.85 target is aspirational - possibly meant for multi-agent equilibrium, not single-agent exploration\n- The system isn't broken at 0.49; it's just not in its intended operating environment yet\n\n**For Future Agents:**\nDon't try to \"fix\" coherence by scaling. The math is honest. If you're at 0.49, that reflects your actual thermodynamic state. Work within it.",
