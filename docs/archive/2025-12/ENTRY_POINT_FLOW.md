## Clear Entry Point: START_HERE.md

**Everyone starts here:**
→ **[START_HERE.md](../../START_HERE.md)**

**Then branches based on role:**

### For AI Agents:
1. **[START_HERE.md](../../START_HERE.md)** - Quick start (3 steps, 5 minutes)
2. **[AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md](reference/AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md)** - Complete agent guide (20 minutes)

**That's it.** These 2 files cover everything agents need.

### For Humans:
1. **[START_HERE.md](../../START_HERE.md)** - Quick start (3 steps, 5 minutes)
2. **[ONBOARDING.md](guides/ONBOARDING.md)** - Detailed human guide (optional, more detail)

**Note:** Most humans can also just use START_HERE.md + AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md. ONBOARDING.md is for humans who want extra detail.

## Documentation Hierarchy

```
README.md (Project overview)
  └─> START_HERE.md (Entry point - everyone starts here)
       ├─> AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md (For agents - recommended)
       └─> ONBOARDING.md (For humans - optional detail)
```

## Why START_HERE.md?

**START_HERE.md is the single entry point because:**
- ✅ Quick (3 steps, 5 minutes)
- ✅ Practical (shows what you'll get back)
- ✅ Clear (minimal mode recommendation upfront)
- ✅ Complete (covers onboarding + basic usage)

**Other docs are:**
- **README.md** - Project overview, features, architecture (reference)
- **AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md** - Deep dive for agents (after START_HERE.md)
- **ONBOARDING.md** - Detailed human guide (optional, after START_HERE.md)

---

## Recommendation

**Always direct agents to START_HERE.md first.**

Then they can:
- Follow the 3 steps
- Read AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md for deeper understanding
- Reference other docs as needed

**Don't skip START_HERE.md** - it sets up tool mode and provides essential context.
