UNITARES Phase-Aware Thresholds (HONEST VERSION)

Resolves the exploration-thermodynamics friction by recognizing that:
- Different phases have different acceptable operating ranges
- Exploration SHOULD have I > E (learning creates disequilibrium)
- The thermodynamic state is honest - we adjust EXPECTATIONS, not MEASUREMENTS

Critical Insight (from claude_opus_governance_explorer_20251127):
- DON'T inflate coherence to make agents look healthier
- DO adjust thresholds to recognize that exploration has different norms
- Maintain single source of truth: C(V) is always the real thermodynamic state

Mathematical Honesty Preserved:
- EISV differential equations unchanged
- C(V) formula unchanged (no transformation!)
- Coherence value is always the true thermodynamic state
- All parameters (α, β, γ, etc.) unchanged

What Changes: Threshold interpretation
- Phase detection from agent history patterns
- Context-appropriate thresholds (not transformed measurements)
- Transparent logging of phase detection reasoning
